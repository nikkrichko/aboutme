### My projects

#### Performance testing projects
	
* Anomaly detection in performance testing (static)
* Anomaly detection for monitoring system (dynamic via Plumber)
* Add machine learning in performance testing
* Add automatic results analysis of performance testing
* Generate recomendation system for performance testing engineer for faster gathering of performance testing results
* Create interactive shiny-dashboard for performancetesting results
* Create robust regression model for faster gathering of performance testing results
* Create CI performance framework in a company
* Invent performane testing pipeline in a company
* Structurated performance methodology in a company
		
#### Data science projects
	
* NLP: QA-fest review analysis
* Regression: Predict performance behaviaor on high load based on low load.
* Forecasting: Create expected requirements for performance testing based on historical vales
* Other: detect anomalies in time series for bug ands route cause detection on performance testing
		
#### Methodology projects
	
* Develop methodology of performance testing managment: "From chaos to application performance managment"
* Develop mothodology for faster gathering performance testing results using machine learning
* Develop strategy (alorythm) about getting information about changes in application performance in one performance run
* Develop approach for predicting expected result without defined requirements (based on historical results and ARIMA forecasting) 
		
#### Educational projects

* Educate students in National aviational university for performance testing
* Mentoring and teaching junior performance test engineers
